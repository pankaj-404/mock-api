            "Rather like gallery-studded Chelsea, Clement Place II is all about the art. You enter from the elevator, into a hallway that leads first to the master bedroom. This soft-grey room has a queen-size bed (with an intriguing canvas above it), a windowside sofa and a marble ensuite bathroom with both a bath and a shower. The next doorway leads to the second bedroom \u2013 yellow-painted, and lined with books as well as paintings \u2013 and the neighbouring bathroom, which has a shower.", 
            "And then at the end of the hallway there\u2019s the open-plan living area. To the right here you\u2019ll find the kitchen \u2013 a smart, contemporary space. Just opposite is the dining area, its table surrounded by paintings and sculptures, and then beyond that there\u2019s a glass-walled sitting area with a designer sofa and a matching armchair. From there, a door opens onto the lofty terrace."
